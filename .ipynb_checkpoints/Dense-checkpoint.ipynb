    "Weights and Biases: Each connection has an associated weight, which gets adjusted during training to minimize the error of the network. Bias terms are also included to provide additional flexibility in learning.\n",

    "Activation Functions: The Dense layer also usually applies an activation function to the weighted sum of the inputs to introduce non-linearity, which helps the network learn more complex patterns. Common activation functions include ReLU, sigmoid, and softmax.\n",
